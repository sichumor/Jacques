You've probably made macarons over a dozen times, but be honest:
you've had more misses than hits. This recipe is just a refinement
of the techniques you should already be practicing. Try it a few times
and see if it yields better macarons.

Ingredients:
140 g almond flour
130 g powdered sugar
100 g egg whites (about three large eggs)
90 g white sugar (could fit in a ramekin)
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
gel food coloring

Directions:
Sift almond flour and powdered sugar together. This will take some
elbow grease for the flour; you want to get it real fine. In your stand
mixer, beat the egg whites for a minute, adding some cream of tartar
beforehand. Beat faster while slowly drizzling in the white sugar.
Form stiff peaks. In a large bowl, gather your meringue and sift in a
third of the almond flour mixture. Fold in until incorporated, then
sift in the rest and fold. Pass the figure-eight test.

Pipe circles onto parchment paper. Whap the pan to release air bubbles.
Let rest at room temperature for 45 minutes, then bake at 300 degrees
for 18 minutes. Cool and form into sandwiches with the filling of your
choice.
