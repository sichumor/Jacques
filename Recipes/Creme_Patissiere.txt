Also known as custard, pastry cream, or damn fine vanilla pudding,
this is a base recipe you'll return to whenever making profiteroles,
eclairs, or Boston Creme Pie.

Ingredients:
3 large egg yolks
2/3 cup sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract
3 tbsp flour
1 cup whole milk

Directions:
Whish sugar, egg yolks and vanilla until smooth. Then whisk in the flour
until smooth. Heat the milk in a saucepan. Once it's hot, use it to
temper the eggs. You'll want to slowly incorporate a little milk at a
time, whisking all the while.

Once it's incoporated, put the mixture back in the saucepan over
medium heat and whisk constantly until it thickens. Store covered
and chill until needed. (You'll want to put seran wrap over the top
so that it doesn't develop a film.)
