You've experimented with different ratios, but this recipe from
Serious Eats gives you the best crepes. Makes three to four.

Ingredients:
1/2 cup flour
pinch of salt
pinch of sugar for sweet crepes
a little vanilla, also for sweet crepes
1/2 cup of milk, plus a little more
1 large egg

Directions:
Mix all ingredients together with an immersion blender. Heat up a
medium skillet over medium heat and spray with pan spray. Pour about
a third cup of batter into the skillet, swirling it in a circle tomake an
even, thin layer across the bottom. Let cook until the top looks dry,
then loosen the sides with a spatula and flip with your fingers. Cook
the other side for thirty seconds to a minute, then transfer to a
plate. Serve with lemon juice and powdered sugar, jam, Nutella,
cookie butter, or whatever else you can think of.
