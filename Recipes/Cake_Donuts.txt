Normally these sorts of donuts are made with sour cream, but Bon
Appetit recommends using yogurt instead. We will not be calling these
yonuts.

Ingredients:
2 cups flour
2 1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp kosher salt
1/2 cup sugar
2 eggs
1 cup Greek yogurt
2 tbsp melted butter
1 tsp vanilla

For the glaze:
3/4 cup powdered sugar
3 tbsp water
zest from 1/4 lemon

Directions:
Whisk dry and wet ingredients in separate bowls, then work the dry into
the wet. Using two sheets of well-floured parchment paper, roll out
the dough to be half aninch think. Use a large coffee cup to cut out
circle, and a small cookie cutter to cutout donut holes. Err on the side
of more flour when working the dough; you can always brush it off later.
Fry for one minute on each side in coconut or vegetable oil.

Mix glaze ingredients in bowl. Drop donuts in and quickly turn over in
glaze, then remove. Serve immediately.
