This is a fun little baking project that can be customized a dozen
different ways. Cherry and almond just happens to be my favorite.

Ingredients:
2 cups flour
1/2 cup sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda

salt
1 cup buttermilk
1 large egg
4 tbsp melted butter
(optional) 1 cup dried cherries
(optional) 1 cup sliced almonds
(optional) 1 teaspoon almond extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees and grease a 9x5 loaf pan. Mix flour,
sugar, baking powder/soda and salt in a bowl. Mix the buttermilk,
egg, and melted butter in another. Mix wet and dry ingredients toggether
until just combined, then add in the optional stuff. Line the greased
pan and bake for 50 minutes, cooling for ten.
