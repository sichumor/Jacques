This goes great over ice cream, profiteroles, or even straight out of
the mason jar. You'll make caramel sauce so often that it's worth
getting the base recipe down.

Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups sugar
Cream of tartar
1/3 cup water
1/3 cup cream
6 tbsp butter, cubed
kosher salt

Directions:
Mix water, sugar, and cream of tartar together in a high sided pot
and bring to boil. It will take some time for this to happen, but then
the color will start to change quickly. When it's a dark amber, remove
from the heat and mix in the butter. It will bubble a lot, so be careful.
Mix in the cream and salt. Let cool and then store. Fills one and a half
mason jars.
