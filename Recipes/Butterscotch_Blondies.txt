Jaya's blondies went for a more cake-like consistency, while these suckers
are fudgy as all get-out. Melting white chocolate into the brown butter
ensures these are just as chewy and chocolate-y as their brown counterparts,
just with a different flavor profile.

11.5 oz all-purpose flour
8 oz butter
7 oz chopped white chocolate
16 oz light brown sugar
3.5 oz white sugar
2 oz malted milk powder
1 3/4 tsp kosher salt
6 large eggs
1 tbsp vanilla extract

Brown the butter and then add in the chocolate. Take it off the heat while you
do the rest.

Cream the sugars, salt, milk powder, eggs and vanilla. Then work in the
butter mixture. Fold in the flour last.

Bake at 350 degrees for 35 minutes. Let cool for an hour.

Notes:

The flavor was great, but these did NOT cook long enough to firm up or hold
their shape. I would scale the whole recipe down by a third and maybe let bake
for 40 minutes. I could tell my sheet pan and mixing bowl couldn't take all
these ingredients, but I kept pushing forward. Flew too close to the sun on
that one.
