This is a test recipe made with the  "new recipe" function of Jacques.
To type this, I simply typed 'new recipe' into Jacques, who then opened
the editor. Note that you can only type one line into it at a time,
with no back spacing between lines. Sorry! The point wasn't to make a
fully functional text editor, but to provide a single place for all the
recipes, along with search functionality.

You can exit the editor by typing 'STOP' (all caps) in a new line.
