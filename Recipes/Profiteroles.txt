These play a role in so many baking entries that they might be
considered a base recipe. Consisting of nothing but choux pastry,
they can be made with so many fillings and toppings that you should
never grow bored with them.

Ingredients:
4 oz liquid (half milk, half water)
2 oz butter (4 tbsp, cubed)
2 oz flour
4 oz eggs (2 large eggs)
dash of salt
pinch of sugar

Directions:
Consult the choux pastry entry for directions. Just note that to
actually bake these, pipe them small-ish and put in an oven heated
to 425 degrees, then turn it down immediately to 375. Bake for about
20 minutes without opening the oven, then let cool until they can be
filled with pastry cream.
