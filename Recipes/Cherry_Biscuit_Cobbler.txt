Somewhere between a cobbler and a shortcake, this dessert combines
fluffy cream biscuits with delicious cherry pie filling.

Ingredients:
2 tsbp sugar
1/2 tsp salt
1 cup all purpose flour, plus more for surface
8 tbsp butter, cut into pieces
2/3 cup heavy cream
1 1/2 bags pitted cherries
1/4 cup more sugar
1 1/2 cornstarch
cinnamon
vanilla and almond extracts
kosher salt
1 1/2 tbsp butter, melted
turbinado sugar for topping

Directions:
Whisk the sugar, baking powder, salt and flour in a bowl. Work in the
butter until it's in pea-sized chunks. Gradually stream in cream. Work
onto a floured surface, roll out, and use a cookie cutter to make
biscuits. Chill while you make the filling.

Combine all the filling ingredients, from the cherries to the salt, in
a large bowl and mix. Preheat oven to 00 degrees. Add the cherry
mixture to a 9x13 inch baking pan, then arrange the biscuits on top.
There should be little to no space between them. Brush with melted
butter and dust with turbinado sugar. Bake for 10 minutes, then lower
heat to 350 degrees, and bake for an hour more.
